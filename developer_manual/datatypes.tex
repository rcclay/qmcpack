\section{Data Types}
The purpose of this section will be to explain the low-level data types used by QMCPACK.
More complex objects, like ParticleSets, deserve their own chapter.  Might also be good
to explain why we have these data types instead of the standard C++ types. 
\begin{itemize}
\item RealType
\item IndexType
\item ComplexType
\item ParticlePos
\item ParticleGrad
\item etc 
\end{itemize}
