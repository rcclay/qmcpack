0.0 BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
  Currently, ion mover code needs to be built with -DBUILD_IONMOVER:BOOL=1 in the cmake 

Fun facts:
1.)  For successful runs, 0 is standard return value in C.  Using this convention.  

TODO:
  I need to figure out how the correct way to initialize and pass the random number generators
  into the IonDriverBase classes.  Currently, I'm *copying* the RNG initialized at the beginning of
  the application into IonMoverFactory, which then copies it into IonDriverBase.  :-/
